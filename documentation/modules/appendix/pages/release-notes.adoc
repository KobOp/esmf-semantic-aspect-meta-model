[[bamm-2.0.0]]
== Release 2.0.0

* Introduce Entity inheritance, the according Meta Model Element `bamm:AbstractEntity` and
  `bamm:AbstractProperty` as well as the `bamm:extends` attribute to define a hierarchy of Entities.
  This replaces the concept of refining an entity and the `bamm:refines` attribute in order to
  reduce complexity and modeling efforts.
* Remove the `bamm:name` attribute to remove redundancy. The "short" name
  of an element is the local name part of its URI, i.e., the part following the `#` symbol.
* The meta model elements `Unit`, `QuantityKinds` and their corresponding attributes have been moved
  from the `unit` namespace to the `bamm` namespace. The unit namespace is now solely reserved for
  the units of the xref:bamm-specification:appendix:unitcatalog.adoc#unit-catalog-units[unit
  catalog] itself.
* The
   https://github.com/OpenManufacturingPlatform/sds-bamm-aspect-meta-model/blob/main/src/main/resources/bamm/unit/2.0.0/units.ttl[formal
   description (units.ttl)] of the units catalog is now automatically generated from its original
   source (see xref:bamm-specification:ROOT:units.adoc[Units]) and the
   https://github.com/OpenManufacturingPlatform/sds-bamm-aspect-meta-model/blob/main/buildSrc/src/main/resources/custom-units.ttl[local adjustments].
* The `localeCode` and `languageCode` attributes have been moved from the `bamm` namespace to the
  `bamm-c` namespace.
* Shared model elements have been adjusted:
** The xref:bamm-specification:ROOT:entities.adoc#point-3d[Point3d Entity] has been changed to use
   Abstract Properties for its components;
** The xref:bamm-specification:ROOT:entities.adoc#time-series-entity[Time Series Entity] has been
   changed to use an Abstract Property for its `value` component
* The attributes `bamm:properties`, `bamm:operations` and `bamm:events` on `bamm:Aspect` are now
  optional, i.e., they do not have to be added any more even when they are empty lists.
* Various issues in the specification (including examples) have been fixed and phrasing has been improved.
