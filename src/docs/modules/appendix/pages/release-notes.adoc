== Release Notes - {meta-model-full-name}

[[bamm-2.0.0]]
=== Release 2.0.0

* Introduces Entity inheritance. The new *Abstract Entity* Meta Model Element and *extends*
attribute may be used to define a hierarchy of Entities in an Aspect Model. The concept of extending
an Entity replaces the existing concept of refining an Entity. The `bamm:refines` keyword was
therefore removed as its semantics are superseded by Entity inheritance.
* The `bamm:name` attribute has been removed, as it encoded redundant information. The "short" name
  of an element is the local name part of its URI, i.e., the part following the `#` symbol.
* The meta model elements `Unit`, `QuantityKinds` and their corresponding attributes were moved from
  the `unit` namespace to the `bamm` namespace. This fixes an inconsistency because the `unit`
  namespace is only intended for the units of the
  xref:bamm-specification:appendix:unitcatalog.adoc#unit-catalog-units[unit catalog].
* The
   https://github.com/OpenManufacturingPlatform/sds-bamm-aspect-meta-model/blob/main/src/main/resources/bamm/unit/2.0.0/units.ttl[formal
   description (units.ttl)] of the units catalog is now automatically generated from its original
   source (see xref:bamm-specification:ROOT:units.adoc[Units]) and the
   https://github.com/OpenManufacturingPlatform/sds-bamm-aspect-meta-model/blob/main/buildSrc/src/main/resources/custom-units.ttl[local adjustments].
* The `localeCode` and `languageCode` attributes were moved from the `bamm` namespace to the
  `bamm-c` namespace.
* Shared model elements have been adjusted:
** The xref:bamm-specification:ROOT:entities.adoc#point-3d[Point3d Entity] has been changed to use
   Abstract Properties for its components;
** The xref:bamm-specification:ROOT:entities.adoc#time-series-entity[Time Series Entity] has been
   changed to use an Abstract Property for its `value` component
* Various issues in the specification (including examples) have been fixed and phrasing has been improved.
